Empowering Pet Owners with Knowledge, One Article at a Time
At AnimaLife, we believe that feeding your dog goes beyond just offering a bowl of food. That’s why we created AnimaLife Academy, a space where pet owners can find expert-backed, science-based insights to raise healthier, happier pets. Whether you're a first-time dog parent or a seasoned pet lover, our goal is to nourish your pet and your knowledge.
Nutritional Needs: Why Size and Age Matter When Feeding Your Dog
Feeding your dog isn’t just about full bowls. It’s about giving them exactly what their body needs at every stage of life. That’s where AnimaLife’s tailored nutrition comes in.
Puppy, Adult, or Senior? Every Age Has Different Needs
Puppies (0-12 months)
Require high-quality protein and healthy fats to fuel rapid growth, with 3–4 meals per day.
AnimaLife Kibble Size: Small and easy to chew for tiny teeth.
Adult Dogs (1-7 years)
Need a balanced mix of protein, fiber, and energy to support daily activity and well-being.
AnimaLife Kibble Size: Tailored to body size: small, medium, or large.
Senior Dogs (7+ years)
Need easier-to-digest protein, joint support, and fewer calories.
AnimaLife’s formulas are adjusted to maintain mobility and healthy weight.
Kibble Size: Softer or smaller depending on dental health.
Your Dog’s Size Matters Too
AnimaLife recognizes that size affects metabolism, energy needs, and even chewing comfort. That’s why we offer size-specific kibble options.
Small Dogs
High metabolism means higher energy needs per kg. AnimaLife’s small kibble is perfectly sized for tiny mouths.
Medium & Large Dogs
Need balanced energy and nutrients. Our standard kibble ensures easy digestion and satisfaction.
Giant Breeds
Require slow, steady growth during puppyhood to protect joints. Our larger kibble helps prevent gulping and supports joint health.

AnimaLife’s Feeding Guide
We’ve formulated our feeding recommendations based on real nutritional science. You'll find these clearly printed on every AnimaLife pack.
