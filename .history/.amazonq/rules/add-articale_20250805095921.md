Empowering Pet Owners with Knowledge, One Article at a Time
At AnimaLife, we believe that feeding your dog goes beyond just offering a bowl of food. That’s why we created AnimaLife Academy, a space where pet owners can find expert-backed, science-based insights to raise healthier, happier pets. Whether you're a first-time dog parent or a seasoned pet lover, our goal is to nourish your pet and your knowledge.
Nutritional Needs: Why Size and Age Matter When Feeding Your Dog
Feeding your dog isn’t just about full bowls. It’s about giving them exactly what their body needs at every stage of life. That’s where AnimaLife’s tailored nutrition comes in.
Puppy, Adult, or Senior? Every Age Has Different Needs
Puppies (0-12 months)
Require high-quality protein and healthy fats to fuel rapid growth, with 3–4 meals per day.
AnimaLife Kibble Size: Small and easy to chew for tiny teeth.
Adult Dogs (1-7 years)
Need a balanced mix of protein, fiber, and energy to support daily activity and well-being.
AnimaLife Kibble Size: Tailored to body size: small, medium, or large.
Senior Dogs (7+ years)
Need easier-to-digest protein, joint support, and fewer calories.
AnimaLife’s formulas are adjusted to maintain mobility and healthy weight.
Kibble Size: Softer or smaller depending on dental health.
Your Dog’s Size Matters Too
AnimaLife recognizes that size affects metabolism, energy needs, and even chewing comfort. That’s why we offer size-specific kibble options.
Small Dogs
High metabolism means higher energy needs per kg. AnimaLife’s small kibble is perfectly sized for tiny mouths.
Medium & Large Dogs
Need balanced energy and nutrients. Our standard kibble ensures easy digestion and satisfaction.
Giant Breeds
Require slow, steady growth during puppyhood to protect joints. Our larger kibble helps prevent gulping and supports joint health.

AnimaLife’s Feeding Guide
We’ve formulated our feeding recommendations based on real nutritional science. You'll find these clearly printed on every AnimaLife pack.

Because Better Care Starts with Knowing More
At AnimaLife, we’re committed to more than just nutrition. Through AnimaLife Academy, we provide pet owners with trusted knowledge to strengthen the bond with their companions. Backed by science and inspired by care, our content helps you understand what your dog truly needs, physically and emotionally.
Feeling Loved: How to Show Your Dog You Care Every Day
Every dog deserves to feel safe, seen, and loved. But love isn’t just about belly rubs and toys. It’s about the little things you do daily that build trust, affection, and joy.
AnimaLife believes that how you show up for your dog emotionally is just as important as how you feed them nutritionally.
Here are a few simple ways to help your dog feel genuinely loved:
Morning Greeting: Start the day with your dog, not your screen. A cheerful “Good morning” and a few gentle pets tell them they matter most.

Walks with Purpose: Walking isn’t just exercise. It’s your dog’s chance to explore the world. Let them sniff, pause, and take their time. It’s their version of social media.

Play = Bond: Playtime is more than fun. It builds connection. Just 10 minutes of fetch, tug-of-war, or hide-and-seek with treats keeps your dog mentally sharp and emotionally fulfilled.

Training Moments: Reinforce simple commands like “sit” or “stay” using praise and treats. Dogs thrive on feeling useful and appreciated. At AnimaLife, we encourage positive reinforcement to help build that trust.

Quiet Togetherness: Your presence means everything. Sit beside your dog while working, reading, or relaxing. Even without words, they feel your love.

Final Note

At AnimaLife, we believe love is an essential part of pet wellness. Through both the food you choose and the time you give, you’re shaping a happier, healthier dog.
Articles like this one are part of AnimaLife Academy, where care meets science and every action counts.

Stay tuned for more trusted articles. Come visit us at upcoming exhibitions where our experts will walk you through both emotional and physical pet care in the AnimaLife way.
